In this project, we have implemented the first module of the paper "Highly Imperceptible and Reversible Text Steganography Using Invisible Character based Codeword" 

Files in this module:

1. priority_queue.py : This is our implementation of the priority queue data structure, which is required for Huffman Encoding.

2. huffman.py : This contains the implementation of Huffman Encoding for secret text. 

3. RSA.py : This contains the implementation of the RSA Algorithm, which we have used to encrypt the secret text. 

4. secret_message.py : This is wrapper class, which combines all the three above mentioned classes and encrupts and encodes the secret message using the mentioned techniques. 


System Requirements:

1. Python 2.7 installed


Usage:

1. Run the command 'python secret_message.py' in the project root directory
2. Enter the secret message
3. Enter the key length (10-40)
