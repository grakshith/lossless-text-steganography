Barry Coopersfield, worried  about the  competition from  Henry
Lancelot's  company, devised a  devious plan to  gain extra money
for  himself.  He  convinced  Bailey  that  they  should  buy  an
insurance  policy in case either of them died, with the surviving
partner getting the insurance money.  After the policy was  taken
out,  Coopersfield took his  souvenir western "six-gun" revolver,
followed Bailey after work, and shot him outside the tobacconist.
Coopersfield  then went to  the Wild West  Show at the Playhouse.
Posing as a stagehand,  he snuck into the  prop room and put  his
revolver  in a prop bin containing other revolvers from the show.
